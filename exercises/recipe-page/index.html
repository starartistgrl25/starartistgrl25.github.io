        <h2>Dessert</h2>
        <h1>Apple Cider Donut Loaf Cake</h1>
        <p>

            This loaf tastes like everything I love about fall — warm spices,
            cozy apple flavor, and that buttery cinnamon sugar crunch on top.
            It’s soft and tender inside, like a donut in cake form,
            but without the frying or 
            the mess. Just bake, slice, and 
            enjoy a little taste of fall in every bite.
        </p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Preheat the oven:</b> 
                Set the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a loaf pan
                with parchment paper, 
                leaving some overhang on the sides for easy
                removal later.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>Reduce the apple cider:</b>
                In a small saucepan, simmer 1½ cups
                apple cider over medium heat for 15–20 minutes 
                until it reduces to 
                about ¾ cup and slightly thickens.
                Let it cool slightly before using.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>Make the cinnamon sugar:</b>
                In a small bowl, mix together the
                ¼ cup white sugar and ½ teaspoon cinnamon until evenly combined. 
                Set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Mix the dry ingredients:</b> 
                In a large bowl,whisk together the 
                flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, 
                baking soda, baking powder, and 
                salt until evenly combined.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Mix the wet ingredients:</b>
                In a separate bowl, whisk together
                both sugars, eggs, oil, reduced apple cider, applesauce, 
                and vanilla
                extract until smooth.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Combine the batter:</b> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry
                ingredients and whisk until just combined — stop as soon as you
                no longer see streaks of flour.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Pour and top:</b> Pour the batter into the lined loaf pan, 
                spreading it evenly. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon sugar mixture 
                evenly over the top.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>Bake:</b> Transfer the loaf pan to the oven and bake 
                for 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted 
                in the center comes out clean.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Finish with cinnamon sugar:</b> Let the loaf cool for about 
                10 minutes, then lift it out of
                the pan and place it on a wire rack.
                Brush the top with melted butter and sprinkle the remaining
                cinnamon sugar evenly so it sticks beautifully.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Slice and serve:</b> Once fully cooled, cut into thick slices
                and enjoy!
